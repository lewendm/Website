In my PhD project, I examine how specific emotion regulation strategies differentially impact risky decisions and cognitive processing (i.e., reliance on analytical vs. inutitive thinking). One form of emotion regulation that I have become increasingly interested in is known as "psychological distancing". While psychological distancing can occur directly by voluntarily adopting an objective and distant perspective on an emotional situation, psychological distancing can also occur indirectly. For instance, psychological distance can be activated by imagining events in the distant future. Recent studies have demonstrated that psychological does indeed influence risky decision making. However, we still don't know how exactly these effects occur. In other words, is the relationship between psycological distance and risk taking explained by reduced affective intensity and more "rational" thinking? This PhD project aims to dig deeper into these questions by assessing emotional, physiological, and cognitive mechansisms underlying this relationship.
