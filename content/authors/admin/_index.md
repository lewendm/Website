I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Leadership & Organizational Behavior at BI Norwegian Business School. My PhD project seeks to understand how emotions and emotion regulation influence risky decisions and cognitive processing (i.e., analytical vs. intuitive thinking). I conduct experiments in a laboratory setting where we use physiological tools that allow us to measure skin conductance and heart rate variability. Recently, we have started experimenting with virtual reality headsets as well. I am a big fan of open and reproducible science (in other words, the way science should be done).
