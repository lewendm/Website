Hi! I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Leadership & Organizational Behavior at BI Norwegian Business School. I am also affiliated with Trope Lab at New York University's Department of Psychology (lab's website: https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/tropelab/about?authuser=0). My PhD project seeks to understand how emotions and psychological distance influence decisions involving risk and uncertainty. Methodologically, I primarily use experiments in order to uncover the causal nature of the relationships. I am a big fan of open and reproducible science. Together with a colleague and PhD candidate, we have set up an open science journal club at our department (ReproducibiliTea BI Oslo) that we are organizing together. The goal of our journal club is to raise awareness of open science and reproducibility (see "Projects" for more info).
