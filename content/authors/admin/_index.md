Hi there! I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Leadership & Organizational Behavior at BI Norwegian Business School. My PhD project seeks to understand how emotions influence decisions involving risk and uncertainty. Methodologically, I primarily use experiments in order to uncover the causal nature of the relationships. I am a big fan of open and reproducible science. I have set up an open science journal club at our department (ReproducibiliTea BI Oslo) that I am currently co-organizing together with another PhD candidate. The goal of our journal club is to raise awareness of open science and reproducibility (see "Projects" for more info).
