      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my PhD project, I examine how specific emotions and psychological distance influence the way people make decisions involving risk and uncertainty. For instance, how do people make risky decisions for the distant future? And what role do emotions play in these decisions?  Recent studies have demonstrated that psychological does indeed influence decision involving risk. However, much less is known about how exactly these effects occur. This PhD project aims to dig deeper into these questions by assessing emotional, physiological, and cognitive mechansisms underlying the relationship between emotion, psychological distance, and risk taking.&lt;/p&gt;
